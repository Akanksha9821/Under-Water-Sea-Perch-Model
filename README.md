# Underwater Sea Perch Model

## Introduction
The **Underwater Sea Perch Model** is a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) designed for real-time control and data acquisition. It features three motors, enabling **3 degrees of freedom (DOF)** for efficient underwater maneuverability. The system is powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, integrated with **Arduino IoT Cloud** for remote monitoring and control. Additionally, a waterproof **ultrasonic sensor** is used for distance measurement, providing crucial object detection capabilities.

## Working Principle
The ROV utilizes **three DC motors** to achieve movement in three axes:
- **Forward and backward motion** (X-axis)
- **Lateral movement (left and right)** (Y-axis)
- **Vertical ascent and descent** (Z-axis)

Each motor is controlled via **pulse width modulation (PWM)**, allowing precise speed regulation. The **ESP32 microcontroller** acts as the brain of the system, handling motor control signals, sensor data processing, and real-time communication with the Arduino IoT Cloud.
